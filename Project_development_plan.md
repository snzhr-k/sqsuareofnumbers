## 1. Project Overview
**Goal**: Provide a complete solution for the HENNGE internship application task by:
- Developing a specific algorithm to generate a sequence of numbers and compute the sum of squares, based on given requirements.
- Submitting the solution via a POST request to the HENNGE servers.
- Preparing a cover letter and a motivation letter as part of the application process.

## 2. Timeline
Total estimated project duration: **10 weeks**
- **Stage 1**: 5 weeks
- **Stage 2**: 3 weeks
- **Stage 3**: 2 weeks

## 3. Milestones & Tasks

  - Time: 1 week
  - Deliverable: Draft of cover letter tailored to HENNGE’s internship requirements.

- **Task 3.2: Draft Motivation Letter**
  - Time: 0.5 week
  - Deliverable: Draft of motivation letter highlighting reasons for applying and career goals.

- **Task 3.3: Review and Finalize Letters**
  - Time: 0.5 week
  - Deliverable: Polished cover and motivation letters ready for submission.

## 4. Deliverables
1. **Algorithm Source Code**  
   - Implemented logic for sequence generation and sum of squares computation.
2. **POST Request Script**  
   - Code for sending data and receiving response from HENNGE servers.
3. **Cover Letter and Motivation Letter**  
   - Written documents tailored for the HENNGE internship application.
4. **Documentation**  
   - Instructions on how to run the code, test it, and submit it.
5. **Test Reports**  
   - Evidence of successful testing and verification for both the algorithm and the POST request.

## 5. Risks and Mitigation Plans
- **Risk**: The algorithm may not handle all edge cases.  
  **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and validation with multiple input scenarios.

- **Risk**: POST request incompatibility or server error.  
  **Mitigation**: Early testing against a mock server or using test endpoints; thorough debugging and error handling.

- **Risk**: Delays in drafting cover letter and motivation letter.  
  **Mitigation**: Allocate dedicated time early, request feedback from peers, and revise promptly.
